# Clinical data analysis

---

# Overview

This project contains a Python script designed for statistical analysis and data processing. The primary goal of the code is to perform various statistical tests on demographic and clinical data from an Excel file, generate summary tables in LaTeX format, and visualize the results through graphs. 

# Goals

1. **Data Processing**: Read demographic and clinical data from an Excel file.
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform t-tests to compare means between two groups.
   - Conduct Mann-Whitney tests for qualitative variables.
   - Execute Chi-squared tests for categorical data analysis.
3. **Summary Tables**: Generate summary tables in LaTeX format for easy reporting.
4. **Visualization**: Create plots (scatterplots, bar plots, heatmaps) to visualize the statistical results.
